            <p>What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage 
                Utahceratops! Come to the Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, 
                Research Curator at the Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's 
                research has focused on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has 
                conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa.</p>
              <p>Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from 
                the University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids, or
                horned dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the 
                growth and function of certopsid horns and frills.</p>
              <p>Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American 
                Museum of Natual History in New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of 
                anatomy at the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the 
                University of Utah accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of 
                Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural 
                History. His research interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional 
                morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.</p>
              <p>In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological 
                work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was 
                also the on-the-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a 
                book, <em>Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life</em>, which is one of the most 
                comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.</p>
